A super simple framework for development is to launch to ssh
connections in two different windows (you cna use putty on Windows).
In one window you can use jed, a simple text mode editor to edit your
source code. In the other you can run (and rerun) your unit tests.
You will write a new function that will plug in the existing
framework. The first thing we will do is create a unit test for the new function
you will be writing.
