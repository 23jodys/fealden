* General stuff
** Get better coverage on the unit tests
** Explore logging a bit more
*** specifically how to get logging of modules to work with some
   granularity, that is to have DEBUG on for only certain modules
** DONE - Extend queue past process boundary so that fealdend could talk to web.py

o [jodys] Features
** DONE -- Search for sensors with max free energy between specified range
** DONE --Specify number of folds in sensor
** DONE -- Add in web.py
** realtime status update for job
** DONE -- solution_element class
** DONE -- add parameters to checknode

* Refactoring
** I should give some more thought to how messages are dispatched 
   through the queues, perhaps a sort of mini-language to specify
   all the parameters and goals, etc.

* Bug fixes
** correct deltaG calculation for gain plot of sensor
** verify all energy calculations
