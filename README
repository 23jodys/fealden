Fealden is a two part server, the first part, fealdend, actually
performs the searching and prepares final output. The second part,
webfealden.py actually provides the web interface. Both parts use a
single configuration file, fealden.ini that must be located in one of
the following places:

/etc/fealden.ini
./etc/fealden.ini
../etc/fealden.ini
./fealden.ini

If fealden.ini is *not* found, then both processes will not start.
